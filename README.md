# code-culture-club
 Digital cultural magazine

Ana, Janet, Kemer and Niamh - we are coders on the Code First Girls: Kickstarter Web Development course, who have formed the 'code culture club' for our team project.

'code culture club' is a monthly online publication showcasing lesser known aspects of international culture. We will be writing about local talent, cuisine, travel and life.

This November issue will feature art and architecture from Ireland, fashion from Italy, modern history from Germany, food and history from Turkey.
